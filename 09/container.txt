ex00: The goal of the exercice is to stock and read a data-base in wich
for each date there is an exchange rate, wich format is "date,value".
For the input file, the format is the same but with "date | value" where
the value is a number between 0 and 1000 and can be a float. For each
line of the input we have to check the date into the db and take the least
closest date compared to the date from the input, then take the value of the
db and multiply it by the value of the input line.

ex01: The goal is to take a string as input that match a reverse polish notation
format. The notation using the principle of stacks, each time a figure
is encountered it is pushed into the stack but when its an operator we use
it on the last two numbers inside the stack, if there is not at least two numbers
or at the end of the program there is numbers left over, this cause a syntax error.
The only operator that are handled are (+, -, *, /), and the only figures are
taken in considerations for input, anything else are discarded/disallowed.
